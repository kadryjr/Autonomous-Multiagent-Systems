# Autonomous-Multiagent-Systems
Technical Report #1
-Choose one of the AI Robot from our case study project.
Write a technical report about it, as follows: - Robot’s abilities, capabilities and the older versions of this robot if there were older versions. - Rationality feature of such a robot - PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) - Environment type of this robot - decide on its agent type.
Technical Report #2
According to the selected AI Robot for your team in Report #1, 
complete your case study work by the following:
➢Formulate the problem precisely.
➢Draw a diagram of the complete state space (Draw a diagram 
showing all the legal states and transitions from states corresponding 
to all legal operations)
➢Solve the problem using two different search algorithms and make a 
complete comparison/discussion between them by considering 
(number of iterations, time and space complexity)
Complete your case study work by this last “complete” report that should include:
➢ Problem Understanding (Formulation)
➢ Analysis (All items of Report#1)
➢ Design (Graph states, Search tree, Solve the problem using two different search 
algorithms justify your selection, discussion between selected algorithms)
➢ (Matlab/Python) Code to find the solution:
- Input: Allow user to select the start/initial state and goal state
- Output: Find the solution to reach the goal state from the initial state. 
- Show the results in terms of the solution found and if it is optimal or nearby the optimal
